# Sharing Shedule Generator
A marketing tool designed to help you effectively share your event with different groups. 

## Introduction
Thank you for downloading and using this sharing schedule generator!

This program is designed to be used as a marketing tool for advertising events on Facebook. One of the ways to maximize the exposure of your event is to share it across different Facebook groups. However, if you share your event too often within the same group, its group members may get annoyed and form a negative impression on your event. The goal of this program is 
to automatically create a sharing schedule, so you can avoid oversharing and worrying about when to share your event and with which group. Even though this program was originally designed for advertising through Facebook, it can also be used for different platforms as long as the same logic applies (advertising your event to different groups of people). 

## Features
* Automatically generates a 7-day marketing schedule detailing which groups you should share your event with on which day.
Currently the program has a standard 7 days of marketing (prior to the event day). This time length is what we have found to be the most effective for our BizTech events.

* Customizable groups 

* Built-in marketing strategies such as:

1. Sufficient day gaps between sharing your event with the same group in order to avoid spamming and annoying group members
2. Customizable target groups, allowing you to maximize your event exposure with the people that you want your event to attract the most
3. More shares on days with more active users. 

* User-friendly interface and display.
